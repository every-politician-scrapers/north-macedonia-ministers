In a decision of November 30, 2020 of the Basic Court in Strumica, Republic of North Macedonia, it was stated that Alexander Barabanovski, who worked as a security guard for Vice Zaev (brother of the current Prime Minister of Republic of North Macedonia Zoran Zaev) on October 21, 2018 punched Mitko Georgiev from Strumica him in the face and ear and addressed him the following insulting and threatening words: \"Fuck your Bulgarian mother, stop attacking the Zaevs, I will kill you if you don’t move out of Macedonia\". \n\nAccording to our sources, during his visits to Strumica, A. Barabanovski also guarded Zoran Zaev. Before becoming prime minister, Zoran Zaev was mayor of Strumica and during his election campaign in 2013 he made and placed an campaign banner on the facade of the Global shopping center in the town square, containing hate speech: \"This is Strumica, not Blagoevgrad (the capital of Pirin Macedonia in Bulgaria).\" Zoran Zaev praised himself for this act on his Facebook profile on March 20, 2013. These examples show that even the family of the current Prime Minister of Republic of North Macedonia, despite his claims that he pursues a friendly policy towards Bulgaria, is directly involved in directing the anti-Bulgarian campaign.",
